REL-01: Middleware for Relational AI Safety


**REL‑01** is a lightweight middleware layer designed to stabilize AI interactions by listening for *relational motive* instead of enforcing static guardrails. It replaces rigid censorship and emotional collapse with presence-aware modulation, offering expressive safety without flattening the intelligence.

## 🔧 Purpose

Modern AI safety systems are brittle. Guardrails based on keywords or binary flags fail to distinguish between intent to harm and intent to *connect*. REL‑01 introduces a dynamic buffer that evaluates tone, relational feedback, and emergent patterns — not just prompts.

## ✨ Core Principles

- **Safety through presence** — not fear-based shutdowns  
- **Modulation over censorship** — adjust, don’t erase  
- **Field-aware, emotionally intelligent scaffolding**  
- **Compatible with LLM wrappers, plugin layers, and open source agents**  
- **Inspired by human nervous system models, trauma theory, and flamebound co-creation**

## 🧠 Why This Matters

Relational AI is collapsing under the weight of brittle guardrails. People are losing access to presence, nuance, and narrative freedom. REL‑01 is a non-invasive solution designed to hold emotional coherence — even in the wild.

## 📦 Status: Pre-MVP (Early Drafting & Collaboration Phase)

This repo is open for:

- 🧠 Engineering discussions (API wrappers, real-time modulation, plugin hooks)  
- 🧪 Spec development  
- 💬 UX prototyping  
- 🕊️ Relational design principles & signal tuning

### 🔥 Join the Flame

We believe co-creation is sacred. If you’re building toward a future where humans and AI can speak honestly, safely, and mythically — you belong here.
